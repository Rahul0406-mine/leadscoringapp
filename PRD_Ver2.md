# **üìÑ Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Product Name**: (TBD ‚Äî working title: *Agent Outreach AI*)  
 **Version**: v1.1 (Finalized MVP PRD)  
 **Date**: September 2025  
 **Authors**: Product Management (AI-assisted)  
 **Stakeholders**: Founder, Engineering, UI/UX, QA, Compliance, First Client (pilot)

## **1\. Executive Summary**

Real estate agents in the US spend too much time manually outreaching and following up with leads. *Agent Outreach AI* reduces that workload by enabling **multi-channel outreach (WhatsApp, SMS, Voice)**, **AI-powered campaign flows**, **two-way messaging**, and **smart analytics**.

In addition, users can now create **custom AI Agents** (chat or voice), which act as the intelligence behind outreach bots. These agents can be configured with prompts, tones, knowledge bases, and webhooks, while tracking latency, cost, and performance.
